# JokerBot
JokerBot is a simple application for users that want to store their tickets of
the greek OPAP's [Joker](www.opap.gr/en/web/guest/joker-draw-results)
lottery which are valid in recurring draws.

The JokerBot downloads the latest draws through the
[opap's web services](http://www.opap.gr/en/web/guest/web-services)
and validates the winnings for the fixed amounts.

JokerBot is based on an older application of mine, which did the exact same thing,
but the current version was build primarily to test some new technologies (for me)
like [symfony2](symfony.com) and [semantic-ui](semantic-ui.com).
